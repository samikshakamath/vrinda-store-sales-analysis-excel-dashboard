## Project Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive sales performance analysis for Vrinda Store (2022)**, implemented entirely in **Microsoft Excel**.  
The objective was to convert raw transactional data into a **structured, analysis-ready format** and design an **interactive executive dashboard** to support data-driven business decision-making.

The analysis focuses on **sales trends, customer demographics, channel performance, geographic distribution, and order fulfilment efficiency**, with an emphasis on clarity, interpretability, and business relevance.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

A rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing workflow was applied in Excel to ensure analytical reliability:

- Removal of duplicate and inconsistent transaction records  
- Standardisation of categorical variables (gender, age group, order status, sales channel)  
- Handling of missing and invalid values  
- Creation of derived fields for:
  - Age group classification  
  - Monthly and annual time analysis  
  - Order status categorisation  
- Validation of sales amounts and order counts for metric consistency  

The resulting dataset supports accurate KPI computation and interactive analysis.

## Key Metrics and KPIs

The dashboard tracks the following core business metrics:

- Total sales value and total order volume  
- Monthly sales and order trends  
- Sales distribution by gender  
- Order status breakdown (Delivered, Cancelled, Returned, Refunded)  
- Channel-wise sales contribution  
- State-wise sales performance  
- Age group vs gender order distribution  

These KPIs provide both **high-level performance monitoring** and **granular diagnostic insight**.
